HOLY TRINITY
dps - primary source of damage
	essentially has 2 jobs
		deal damage
		stay alive
	usually squishy for balance
tank - frontline and cc
	has several jobs
		SOAK DAMAGE
		support w cc
		deal enough damage to draw aggro
healer
	subclass of support
	job is almost exclusively heals
		keep tank alive to soak damage
		keep dps alive to deal damage
	doesn't interact with enemies in the same way
strengths
	roles cover each other's weaknesses
	great synergy for parties of 3
flaws
	doesn't work as well outside multiples of 3
	restricts mechanics to certain roles
		doesn't allow for characters like pyke or vi
	leads to things like role lock in overwatch
	forces roles to interact w the game in certain ways
	games designed around trinity don't support other compositions v well


FIXING THESE FLAWS
	give every class general skills but each class their own specialized skills
	more general skills = broader more flexible game
		better for single player
	more specialized skills = tighter stricter game
		better for multiplayer
SPECIALIZATION INSIDE CLASSES
	skill trees
	unique abilities within classes
		not just unique visuals or damage
		unique subtypes as a whole
