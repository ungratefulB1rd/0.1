what is the simulation called? will refer to as SIM for rn

what color is SIM?
	like how the matrix is green
	i was thinking either red or electric blue
	I've always envisioned the simulation with a magenta/pink sky. Electric blue would be cool but blue typically doesn't convey feelings of distres-
	it's moreso a happy, calm color and should be used appropriately. Nothing about the overworld should invoke feelings of calm. Red could 
	suffice.

	
who is/are the main antagonists and could u pls describe them a bit
