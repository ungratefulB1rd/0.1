combat that will player engaged thru entire story
need new things to shake up combat regularly so it doesnt stale
no level grinding
no random encounters
zubat genocide is not fun
without the need for exp, random encounters kinda lose their niche
"normal enemies exist to set the tone and pacing of an area
and offer smaller more contained challenges than the more dramatic rules changes u find in bossfights"
chronotrigger uses handmade encounters that i think works well
few fights but memorable fights
i need to play chrono trigger
add enough content outside combat to keep combat refreshing
