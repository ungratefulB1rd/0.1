VITAL STATS
more or less health bars
most enemies use these as health bars too
	WILLPOWER
		keeps soul tethered to "body"
		when it runs out, go to "hell"
		physical damage hits this stat
		physical attacks could also be based off this stat
		healed passively slowly
		enemies that aren't sentient don't use this stat

	SANITY
		mental fortitude
		responsible for maintaining sense of self
		when it runs out, become corrupted and mutate
		mental damage hits this stat
		healed by meditating or something

	some 3rd stat that's basically how well ur code functions
		when it runs out, encounter a fatal error and u just crash
		healed by debugging
		
	FIREWALL
		shield like buffer that protects against certain types of attacks
		uses bandwidth every turn
		can be repaired at the cost of PP
		most digital attacks deal reduced damage to it
		most physical attacks either deal bonus damage or just ignore completely
		many units in the game simply don't have one
		if it runs out, attacks deal damage to ur other vital stats


PROCESSING POWER - PP
main gimmick of combat
primary combat stat
recharges each turn
the more PP missing the slower it recharges
	allows for major turns where u dump all ur PP but have to slowly recharge
determined by several things
	
	PROCESSING SPEED
		part of ur speed stat
		increases power of some types of attacks
	
	PROCESSING BANDWIDTH
		allows for more concurrent effects with less impact on PP
		increases power of some types of attacks
	
	STORAGE
		inventory space more or less
		smaller max storage increases processing speed
		higher max storage increases bandwidth
		using smaller % of max storage increases processing speed
